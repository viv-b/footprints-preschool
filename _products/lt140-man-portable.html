    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>The LT140 man portable rig uses quality components which include; Braden Winch, Kubota Engine, Rexroth Hydraulics.<br />The Drivehead has been specially designed to be small and compact, while not compromising strength and ability. The drivehead can be used for both air core and wireline drilling, and also utilizes a floating spindle design for easy connections to drill rod.</p>
    <p>The LT140 also uses a three piece mast, with the largest piece of the mast only 2.4m long. This allows for ease of transport through tight locations while also giving the operator the option of using a shorter mast if required.</p>
