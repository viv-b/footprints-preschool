                	<blockquote><p><strong><em>&ldquo;It takes a village to raise a child&rdquo;</em></strong></p></blockquote>
                	<p>Parents and whanau are very much a part of this process. We want parents to view Footprints as another home away from home &ndash; a place where they can come and relax, stay as often as they like and to be involved in their child&rsquo;s exciting learning journey. We respect and acknowledge the knowledge that parents have and can contribute and we involve them as often as possible in the centre life.&nbsp;</p>
                	<h3>Settling in</h3>
                	<p>The settling process is where it all starts. We do not put a time limit on this and encourage parents to visit the centre as often as they like prior to starting. We believe that developing a trusting relationship with your child is the most important part of this process and understand that this takes time. During the settling process teachers will speak with parents about their child&rsquo;s needs and their aspirations for them.</p>
                	<p>In the infants and toddlers room, the settling in process especially important. This is why we work closely with parents to ensure to best possible transition. In the early stages visits are kept short, with the length of time increasing as time goes on. We encourage parents to change their child&rsquo;s nappy in front of a teacher so that we develop an understanding of what the child is used to. The next nappy change the teacher will do in the presence of the parent to ensure we are doing this correctly. Likewise the parent will put their child to bed for their first sleep and be there when they away to lessen any anxiety that the child may have. All children are more than welcome to bring special cuddly toys and items from home to help with this process.</p>
                	<h3>Communication</h3>
                	<p>Good communication is vital to ensure the smooth running of the centre. Newsletters are given to parents each month informing them of important events. We also use EDUCA (our online child portfolio page) to communicate matters as well. We also put information on our webpage of special things that we have done and on occasions we also place this on Facebook. We also hold several parent evenings every year at the centre. Parents are involved monthly in the development of our policies where they are given the opportunity to read and comment on them. Parents are also involved in regular surveys each year on a range of topics, including philosophy development, centre direction, environment development and curriculum matters to name just a few. Parents of infants are provided with daily communication booklets, informing them of daily routines (feeding, sleeping and nappy changes) and how their day was. Both parents and teachers review the child&rsquo;s learning stories on three occasions during the year to further their learning.</p>
                	<h3>Sleeping</h3>
                	<p>Older children have the opportunity to sleep or rest on mattresses in a quiet private room. For the infants and toddlers they have the choice of either sleeping in a cot or in a hammock. Discussions on sleep routines are always held with parents so that we can best support children with this process. We do not have set times that children sleep, rather this is based on the needs of the child and so they will sleep at various times throughout the day.</p>
                	<h3>Transitioning</h3>
                	<p>Transitioning between the under two&rsquo;s and the over two&rsquo;s is based on several things. The ability and willingness of the child and parent and teacher collaboration. Discussions are held prior to this process taking place well in advance. To further support this process one of the infants and toddlers teachers will also transition out with the child and stay with them until they have completely settled. The transitioning teacher will be responsible for providing communication to the parent and maintaining the child&rsquo;s portfolio during this time.</p>
                	<h3>Kai</h3>
                	<p>Parent&rsquo;s supply food for the child&rsquo;s morning tea, lunch time and afternoon tea. We encourage parents to supply a balanced and healthy lunchbox. If children want to bring their own water bottle then this is fine. Children have access at all times to water.</p>
                	<h3>Clothing</h3>
                	<p>Children will need sufficient clothing to last for the day. Children will typically encounter various types&rsquo; of activities, including water, mud and paint play. Parents will need to supply at least two full changes of clothing in a named bag (If a child is toilet training they may require more). All clothing needs to be named. A named sunhat needs to be supplied during the summer months. In the hotter months we ask that parents please sunblock their child before arriving at the centre.</p>
                	<h3>Birthdays</h3>
                	<p>Children and parents are welcomed to celebrate birthday at the centre. If parents wish to supply a cake or other food for their child&rsquo;s special day, then they are more than welcomed to do so.</p>
                	<h3>Soul Room &ndash; The Infants and Toddlers Room</h3>
                	<p>The relationship is everything. The Pikler Approach underpins everything we do in the Soul room - and the centre. Infants and toddlers are nurtured by highly experienced and knowledgeable teachers, who are unhurried and responsive to the needs and cues of the child.</p>
                	<p>There are no set routines in the Soul room &ndash; rather the day is based on the needs of the child. Children enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play and exploring. Milestones and events are recorded in children&rsquo;s Communication books.</p>
                	<h3>Complaints Procedure</h3>
                	<p>All complaints are to be taken up with Phil Davison (the centre manager), in the first instance. We do our best to find a quick resolution to all complaints. If a formal complaint is to be made parents need to do this in writing. The complaints procedure is displayed at the centre.</p>
