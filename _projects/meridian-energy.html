    <p>This project, carried out from 2007 to 2008 involved potential dam-site investigation drilling at the Mokihinui River on the West Coast of the South Island.</p>
    <p>Helicopters were used to move the drilling rig and equipment between holes. Nine holes were drilled in and around the river on flat and sloping sites, with care taken when drilling close to the unstable rivers edge. Staff also needed to be aware of the rising river during heavy rains and potential flooding of the drill site.</p>
    <p>Holes at the edge of the river required platforms to be built out over the river to allow correct placement of the drilling rig. Drilling on the sloping hills required 60Ëšplatforms to be designed and purpose-built for the terrain.</p>
    <p>Packer tests were carried out every 15 metres.</p>
    <p>Environmental considerations included pollution prevention (no drill muds used), water recirculation, and the construction of houses for endangered snail species.</p>
