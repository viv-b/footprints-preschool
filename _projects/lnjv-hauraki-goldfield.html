    <p>The LNJV Gold Project is a Farm-In agreement between Laneway Resources &amp; Newcrest Mining New Zealand covering two large exploration permits (Waitekauri, EP53469 and Owharoa, EP54216).</p>
    <p>The project is located 110km southwest of Auckland near the township of Waihi on New Zealands north island, within the prospective Hauraki Goldfield which has produced over 40,000,000 ounces of Au-Ag bullion from over 50 deposits to date. The LNJV Gold project surrounds New Talisman Goldsâ€™ mining permit and abuts Oceana Golds producing Waihi Mine.</p>
    <p>Alton Drilling is the preferred drilling contractor for the LNJV which is committed to operating in an environmentally responsible manner from drill site preparation through to rehabilitation.</p>
