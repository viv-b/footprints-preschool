    <p>Muirs Reef has long been an area of interest for gold, with mining on the reef until the 1930â€™s. This project has involved drilling a number of exploration holes near the reef on a mix of farmland and forest blocks.</p>
    <p>On our most recent sites we have been using an XHD1150 wireline core rig mounted on a Marooka. This rig with a Marooka based rod carrier have proven to be essential for accessing difficult sites in forested areas of the reef, particularly during the winter months while ground conditions were challenging.</p>
