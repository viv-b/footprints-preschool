    <p>Alton Drilling was awarded a four year contract with Manukau Wastewater Services which involved the following projects;</p>
    <p>1999 – 2003: Airlift Temporary Dewatering System installed.<br />1999 – 2003: Permanent Dewatering System designed and installed.<br />1999 – 2003: Miscellaneous concrete cutting, sawing, and drilling.</p>
    <p>The original tender had requested that electric pumps be utilised as part of the temporary dewatering project. The pumps were to be a consumable item and would need to be replaced every 3-6 months at an average cost of $3000.00 per pump.</p>
    <p>After reviewing the tender, Alton Drilling liaised with MWS to provide a new innovative system to replace the electric pumps. Pneumatic pumps were sourced from overseas and then supplied at a fraction of the cost. The pumps were over 300% more reliable and no replacements were required.</p>
    <p>Not only did this system produce a significant financial saving but the highest savings were from the reliability of the system. The pumps do not require further maintenance and also reduce safety concerns as they do not require an electric supply.</p>
    <p>This project highlights Alton Drilling’s innovative approach, ensuring our customers receive the best solution for their needs.</p>
