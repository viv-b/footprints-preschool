    <p>During 2004 whilst working for Newmont Waihi, Alton Drilling underwent an extensive sound proofing and noise reduction project with our drilling rigs.</p>
    <p>Low noise emissions were required due to the close proximity of drilling to residential housing. We removed the diesel engine from our first rig and installed an electric motor. Our second rig was installed inside a 20ft high cube container with sound proofing on walls.</p>
    <p>Through these measures Newmont Waihi and Alton Drilling were able to improve community relations and also enable higher core production from running the operations 24 hours per day.</p>
