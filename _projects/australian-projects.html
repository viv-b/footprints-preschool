                	<p>Alton Drilling is also involved with drilling projects in Australia.</p>
                	<p>We have been Diamond drilling for an extensive copper mineral exploration contract in Cloncurry, Queensland over the past 6 years. This has involved 30,000 m of drilling undertaken mainly in NQ and HQ size drilling. We used our HD900 steel-tracked Rig which allows for quick moving and line up over pre-collared holes, as well as several other rigs as required.</p>
                	<p>Other projects have included drilling programmes in the Black Snake Plateau Region and supplying a number of Track Mounted HD900 and MD600 Rigs into Western Australia.</p>
