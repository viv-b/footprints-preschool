    <p>Australian owned company, Auzex, employed Alton Drilling to complete a 1200m drilling project in Reefton, on the West Coast of New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Due to the remote site location (altitude at 4,500 feet â€“ tussock snow grass), a full camp was set up near the drill sites. This involved flying all gear, including a caravan, site office, utility rooms, and all cooking and cleaning facilities, in by helicopter.</p>
    <p>The drill rig was situated below the tree-line and the water supply was approximately 1200m away in very sheer terrain, requiring 2 stage pumping. Extensive drill platforms were constructed at each site to allow for placement of the drilling rig on the steep hill angles.</p>
    <p>Communication was maintained through a satellite phone and regular visits by helicopter. All drilling gear, including the rig, was flown in and set up on each drill site, then packed up and moved on to the next hole.</p>
