    <p>Alton Drilling designed and built a base camp for a customer undertaking a major project on the West Coast of New Zealand.</p>
    <p>We were able to supply a turnkey solution for accommodation, with a high standard of camp huts and living areas. Bunkrooms, Kitchen, Toilet, Laundry, and stores are all contained in modular units that can be flown to site.</p>
    <p>With a covered deck between huts, and smart design we have provided a high quality base camp to ensure staff on a remote project can spend their time off in comfort. Home away from home!!</p>
