                	<p class="lead">All children (ages 0-5) receive <strong>30 free hours</strong> of care (so no cost to you).</p>
                	<h3>Extra Hours</h3>
                	<p>If a child does more than 6 hours per day at the centre then the hourly rate of $5.00 applies. Extra hours over the child&rsquo;s booked times will also incur the $5.00 per hour charge.</p>
                	<h3>WINZ Subsidy</h3>
                	<p>All parents who qualify for a WINZ subsidy are expected to do so to offset our low fee structure. We will assist you with this.</p>
                	<h3>Holidays and Absences</h3>
                	<p>We do not charge for public holidays.</p>
                	<p>You will still be charged if your child is absent.</p>
                	<p>Every child is given 15 days holiday per year. If your child is away for longer than this please speak to the Centre Manager. <em>Two week&rsquo;s notice is required of any leave as it may affect staffing ratios.</em></p>
