Footprints Preschool had a wonderful Christmas evening with all the parents, whanau and children. Everyone enjoyed some lovely shared kai and then Santa arrived in the Fire Truck (thanks Waihi Fire Brigade) to hand out the presents. A big thanks to all the families who have supported us in 2018. You guys are the best. Thanks for allowing us the special privilege of caring for your children. Have a great Christmas and a happy New Years.
