                    <h3>Pauline Davison</h3>
                    <p>Hi I am Pauline.<br />The development of Footprints Preschool started literally over a cup of tea and an idea on how we would love to have a centre that caters for the needs of the community. Footprints was the end result of our collective vision. I believe that children need an unhurried and supportive environment that nurtures and grows relationships. I view each child as an individual in their own right; each one with unique and different needs.</p>

                    <h3>Philip Davison</h3>
                    <p>Kia ora koutou.<br />I have been managing Footprints since 2013. I am a registered teacher with a Bachelor of Teaching (ECE) Degree. I am married to Pauline and we have 3 girls. I have a passion for the outdoors, messy play and love to see children having fun and learning through their play. I like to make each day different for the children and love seeing that “wow” moment when a child achieves a new goal. Having spent over a decade previously as a frontline Police Officer in the New Zealand police before starting teaching, I truly believe that all children need a loving environment and be surrounded by adults who are truly committed to making a difference in their lives.</p>

                	<h2>The Soul Room - Infants and Toddlers</h2>
                	<p><strong>The relationship is all.</strong> Developing a relationship with children and families that is real and genuine comes before everything else.</p>
                	<p>The Soul Room is a calm and nurturing environment, supported by teachers who are unhurried in their teaching practices. Children are free to explore the environment; both inside and outside.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p>Children will enjoy long periods of uninterrupted play. The teacher&rsquo;s role in this very important process is to observe and only step in when required to do so.</p>
                	<p>All practices in the Soul Room are guided by the Pikler Principles. Everything that happens in this room is centred around the needs of the child. Important care moments such as feeding, nappy changing and sleeping are based on the individual requirements of the child.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p><strong>Feeding</strong><br />Infants are always held while being fed. They are never put into a position that they cannot get into themselves. Children are encouraged to develop their independence and can access their food when they feel hungry.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p><strong>Sleeping</strong><br />In the Soul Room children have the choice of either sleeping in a cot, hammock or mattress. Discussions are held with families around the needs of the child. It is preferred that parents be present for their child&rsquo;s first sleep and there when they awake.</p>
                	<p><strong>Nappy changing</strong><br />Nappy changing is carried out in partnership with families. As with the sleeping routine, it is preferred that parents do their child&rsquo;s first nappy change with the teacher observing. On the second nappy change the teacher changes the nappy with the parent observing. By doing this we are ensuring that we are best meeting the needs of your child.</p>
                	<p><strong>Primary Care</strong><br />Each child has a Primary Caregiver, who is responsible for the child&rsquo;s daily needs and communicating with parents.</p>
                	<p><strong>Transitions</strong><br />Transitioning into the over two&rsquo;s are is a process that is developed in partnership between family and teachers. The decision to transition the child is based on several factors, such as the ability to manage self, communication, physical and social competency.&nbsp;</p>
                	<h2>Explorers</h2>
                	<h2>Transition to School</h2>
                	<p>Starting the transition to school is a process that is carried out in partnership between the parent and teacher.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p>This process normally starts a year before the child is ready to start school. At this time teachers will start to make links between the child&rsquo;s learning at the centre and school.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p>To support this process children are exposed to a wide range of experiences at the centre, which include frequent outings in the centre van. Examples of these include visits to local business and outings into the natural environment, such as Waihi Beach, nearby parks, walking tracks and streams.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p>Teachers will also accompany children on school visits and then develop a school readiness booklet to give to the child&rsquo;s new entrant teacher that demonstrates the child&rsquo;s school readiness.&nbsp;</p>
                	<p>We are advocates for children staying at the centre until they turn 6 years of age.</p>
