                    <h3>Pauline Davison</h3>
                    <p>Hi I am Pauline.<br />The development of Footprints Preschool started literally over a cup of tea and an idea on how we would love to have a centre that caters for the needs of the community. Footprints was the end result of our collective vision. I believe that children need an unhurried and supportive environment that nurtures and grows relationships. I view each child as an individual in their own right; each one with unique and different needs.</p>

                    <h3>Philip Davison</h3>
                    <p>Kia ora koutou.<br />I have been managing Footprints since 2013. I am a registered teacher with a Bachelor of Teaching (ECE) Degree. I am married to Pauline and we have 3 girls. I have a passion for the outdoors, messy play and love to see children having fun and learning through their play. I like to make each day different for the children and love seeing that “wow” moment when a child achieves a new goal. Having spent over a decade previously as a frontline Police Officer in the New Zealand police before starting teaching, I truly believe that all children need a loving environment and be surrounded by adults who are truly committed to making a difference in their lives.</p>
