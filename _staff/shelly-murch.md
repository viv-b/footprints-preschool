I have been apart of the early childhood sector/industry for the past 18 years, starting as a nanny then going on to achieve a Bachelor of teaching ECE. I have been a tutor for the Open Polytechnic and mentored a number of teachers over the past 18 years.

My passion is to give children the love of learning, so they are able to achieve their goals and milestones in their own time and space. To care for children like they are my own and give them the respect and love like they would get from their parents. I believe this can be achieved by creating an environment that reflects their own home life and to build respectful, trustworthy relationships with children and families.
