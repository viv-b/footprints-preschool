I have been working at Footprints for over three years as a reliever. I have just completed a Commerce Degree and I am about to start my Postgraduate Diploma in Early Childhood Education next year. When I see the children with smiles on their faces and achieving success in their play, it brings me huge amounts of satisfaction. I am an energetic and outgoing person and love to be involved in spontaneous learning moments with the children.
