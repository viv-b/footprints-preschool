I have been working at Footprints for over three years. First as a reliever, and then a full time teacher. I am also keeping busy completing my Postgraduate Diploma in Early Childhood Education. When I see the children with smiles on their faces and achieving success in their play, it brings me huge amounts of satisfaction. I am an energetic and outgoing person and love to be involved in spontaneous learning moments with the children.
