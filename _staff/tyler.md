Hi, I'm Kerrilee, the newest member of the Footprints crew. I have three adult children ranging in age from 18 to 26. I used to be a playcentre Mum and have enjoyed coaching many of my childrenâ€™s sporting teams over the years.

I have been working as an Early Childhood Teacher for five years in Hamilton, and have recently made the move to Waihi Beach. Being a part of little peoples' lives and helping them learn and grow is a true privilege. I am looking forward to meeting you, learning about your children, and being a part of their learning journey at Footprints.
