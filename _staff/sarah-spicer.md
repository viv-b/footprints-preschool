My name is Kayla, I am 23 and started out at Footprints doing my work experience for school, then as a reliever and now I am a full time teacher. I started full time early 2019. I love working with children and watching them develop all their milestones and having lots of fun along the way. Having strong relationships with the children means they can trust you and they can come to you when they need you most. I am currently unqualified but have the national certificate in ECE level 3, in the future I do hope to study ECE more.&nbsp;
