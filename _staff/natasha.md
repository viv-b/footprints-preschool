Kia ora koutou. My Namne is Natasha but I am known as Tash. I live in Waihi with my three beautiful children. I qualified with a Diploma in ECE in 2004 from the NZ Tertiary College. I have worked in a variety of centres in Auckland and the Waikato. At the very core of my philosophy and practise is authentic relationships with children. I understand that my role is to nurture and support their growth and development through authentic respectful relationships.
