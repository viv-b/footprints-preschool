Tēna koutou katoa.<br>My name is Susan Lemmens and I am married to Louis who is a social worker. We have three adult children, two grandchildren children. Louis and I moved to Waihi 4 years ago from Hamilton. We love the natural beauty of the area and both have happy memories of holidays by the sea, and love living close to the coast. We have a Ducati motorbike and love exploring New Zealand and particularly enjoy the twisty roads of the Coromandel.

I have connections with Ngāti Porou on the East coast on my grandmothers side of the family and the Bay of Islands on my dad's side, when the first missionary and non-missionary settlers arrived under the care and protection of Chief Ruatara (Ngā Puhi) in 1814.

I trained as a kindergarten teacher way back in 1980 at Hamilton teachers college and have been teaching for approximately 20 years. I am passionate about what I do and have always considered it a privilege to be part of the educational journey of young children and their natural desire to explore and discover the world around them.<br>&nbsp;
