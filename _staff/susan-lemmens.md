TÄ“na koutou katoa.<br>I am married to Louis who is a social worker. We have three adult children, Marcel (who sadly passed away aged 22 in 2005, Felicity 26 years, Richard 33 who is married to Rafael and they have two children August nearly two and India who is 3 months old.

Louis and I moved to Waihi 4 years ago from Hamilton. We love the natural beauty of the area and both have happy memories of holidays by the sea, and love living close to the coast. We have a Ducati motorbike and love exploring New Zealand and particularly enjoy the twisty roads of the Coromandel.

My dad was born and raised in Paeroa and my mum's grandfather was a gold miner in Waihi, eventually settling his family in Gisborne.

I have connections with Ngati Porou on the East coast on my grandmothers side of the family and the Bay of Islands on my dad's side, when the first missionary and non-missionary settlers arrived under the care and protection of Chief Ruatara (Nga Puhi) in 1814.

I trained as a kindergarten teacher way back in 1980 at Hamilton teachers college and have been teaching for approximately 20 years. I am passionate about what I do and have always considered it a privilege to be part of the educational journey of young children and their natural desire to explore and discover the world around them.
