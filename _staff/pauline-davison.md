Hi I am Pauline.<br>The development of Footprints Preschool started literally over a cup of tea and an idea on how we would love to have a centre that caters for the needs of the community. Footprints was the end result of our collective vision. I believe that children need an unhurried and supportive environment that nurtures and grows relationships. I view each child as an individual in their own right; each one with unique and different needs.
