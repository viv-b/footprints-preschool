Kia ora koutou.<br>I have been managing Footprints since 2013. I am a registered teacher with a Bachelor of Teaching (ECE) Degree. I am married to Pauline and we have 3 girls. I have a passion for the outdoors, messy play and love to see children having fun and learning through their play. I like to make each day different for the children and love seeing that “wow” moment when a child achieves a new goal. Having spent over a decade previously as a frontline Police Officer in the New Zealand police before starting teaching, I truly believe that all children need a loving environment and be surrounded by adults who are truly committed to making a difference in their lives.
