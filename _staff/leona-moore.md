I have been involved in Ece and parent education for the past 13 years and hold a Playcentre level 4 qualification. I have been trained by Pennie Brownlee and Kimberly Crisp to hold respectful parenting courses within the community. The practice of working in partnership with children and parents through education is my passion. Currently I am working towards my Bachelor of Teaching in Ece. I believe in creating a supportive stable environment where children can play out their intelligents to their highest potential.
